A :- B1, B2, ..., Bn.

Headed clause is a rule
Headless clause is a bunch of things in a query
    ? p(a), q(a), r(a)
No other case where Headless happens
Rule with bunch of things is also Headed
    pq(X) :- p(X), q(X)
Is Headed(Fun(pq, [X]), [Fun(p, [X]), Fun(q, [X])])

A is the HEAD of the rule
B-s are the literals

A query is also a GOAL
